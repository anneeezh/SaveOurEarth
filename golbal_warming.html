            The more you drive, the more gasoline is used. Carbon dioxide and Nitrous Oxide are greenhouse gasses.

            In the article, ‚ÄúWalking Drastically Cuts Your Carbon Footprint ‚Äì And Helps Your Waistline‚Äù, by Anna Laycock,  their study showed that walking 1.5 miles release 75%  less greenhouse gases than driving to your destination would.

            While on a local scale, driving may not seem to do as much harm, on a global scale with billions of people driving daily, the greenhouse gasses build up.

        <h2>
          Greenhouse gasses contribute to Global Warming by capturing infrared rays, 
          the rays bounce around the atmosphere, but are not released to space due to 
          the fact that the greenhouse gasses make the sun rays stay. 
          This is the greenhouse effect.

        <h2>
          The greenhouse effect along with the greenhouse gasses keeps our earth warm 
          and allows life on earth. This is a good thing. The bad thing is that with too 
          much greenhouse gasses, the earth is getting too warm.

          The sea ice melting affects the polar bears 
          because polar bears hunt on the sea ice. 
          With less sea ice, which is their preferred hunting ground, 
          Polar bears start to starve. 
          Making the polar bears home, feel like a place unlike home.
